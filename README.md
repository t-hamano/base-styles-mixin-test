This repository is a test repository to help migrate the @wordpress/base-styles package to Dart Sass in the Gutenberg project.

The `perf-envs` directory is git-ignored, so we will use this directory to test.

```
cd /path/to/gutenberg/perf-envs
git clone https://github.com/t-hamano/base-styles-mixin-test.git
cd base-styles-mixin-test
npm install
npm run build
```
